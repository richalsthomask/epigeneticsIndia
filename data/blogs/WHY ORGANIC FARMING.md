“Why?” is the most relevant question we should ask whenever our conscious attention is called upon change. The “Why?” for the transition to organic farming is usually answered with the harmful effects of current commercial farming practices. I would like to build the narrative for a transition to organic farming not based on fear but the prospect of superior health – “the Hunzian health”.

The hunza valley is located near the Mintaka pass(India to China), in northern part of India with Gilgit being a nearby airport. In the first half of 20th century , the British scientific community got interested in the Hunza’s after coming across various accounts of them by the travellers along Mintaka Pass. The Hunza’s were widely known for their mountaineering skills in high altitude, joyful nature and superior physical health sometimes travelling for 60 miles to Gilgit in a stretch.
Mccarrison and wrench among other scientists got interested in Hunza’s for two reasons;
firstly, obviously the superior health :
secondly, the lack of such Marvelous health among the nearby settlements.
The second reason importantly, implies that the superior health of Hunza’s is not an accidental geographical phenomena but a result of good diet and sound farming practices.

So, what about hereditary? Wrench had his say about the matter as follows.
“As the first settlement of Nagir was from Hunza, the Hunza and Nagiris have been classed as one race. But the first settlement was many centuries ago, and since then many Kashmiris have entered Nagir and overwhelmed the earlier settlers. But they were kept out of Hunza. About the only remnant of relationship between the two peoples is that they both speak the Burushaski tongue. So do some people in Yasin and Punyal. There has been mixture. This is even seen in Hunza. But the majority of the Hunza in Hunza are distinguished by their fair skins, and they themselves scoff at being of the same blood as the smaller, dark Nagiris”
-Wrench , The Wheel of health
The above statement suggests hereditary, although relevant, is a limited factor for the Hunzian Health.

Hunzian Diet
The Hunzian diet consisted of wheaten bread, barley and millet, a variety of vegetables and fruits. They have milk, buttermilk, clarified butter, and curd-cheese. They have occasional meat. They rarely have any fish or game. They take wine on special occasions.
All that can be said about their diet planning i.e. the food combinations and eating intervals, is they are based on custom and it simply works.

The more important aspect is the wholeness of their foods.
Let’s use wheat as an example. Wheat has primarily 3 parts – the bran, the germ and the endosperm. The Hunza’s consume this whole grain as such. Modern man consumes wheat without the germ. The germ reduces the shelf life of wheat and is removed as the first step in commercial milling process. Generally, whenever whole grains is mentioned in the label or elsewhere, it means the bran is present or that the lost elements from germ are added back artificially.  
The Hunza’s ate whole foods without any processing that led to fragmentation and loss of vital elements.
Eating whole foods and an optimal diet are elements of good health, but its effectiveness is entirely dependent on the primary element, good farming practices.
Hunzian Agriculture
The Hunzian agriculture is a marvel because of the geography of the landmass it incorporates, which aligns closest with the ancient Peruvian stairway of terraced fields. Wrench elaborates in great detail the astonishing engineering feat accomplished by these “semi civilized” people. The soils in the fields are replenished by a sprinkling of the black glacier-ground sand, which Sir Albert Howard attributes limestone like properties for soil enhancement.
The Human aspect of their agriculture is primarily composting. Here is a passage from Wrench’s book, that explains their composting practices.
“The Hunza, in their manuring, use everything that they can return to the soil. They carefully collect the cattle manure and store it in the byres. They collect all vegetable parts and pieces that will not serve as food to either man or beast, including such fallen leaves as the cattle will not eat, and mix them with the dung and urine in the byres. They use the human sewage after keeping it for six months. They take silt from special recesses built in their irrigating channels. They collect the ashes of their fires. All these they mix together and make into a compost. They also spread alkaline earth from the hills on their vegetable fields on days when the fields are watered.”
The Wheel of health

The Hunzas generations prior to sir Albert Howard’s development of Indore composting process, using similar principles of composting successfully to attain epigenetic health, described as being fun natured and resilient (two words that don’t make sense together to modern man), with lifespans of over 100 years.

The Hunzas had 3 elements to their health– favourable diet, natural unprocessed whole foods and organic farming (good farming practices)
This is the Hunzian model, very similar to Peruvian, have simply followed a tradition that incorporates sound agricultural practices. It would be wise for us to understand and incorporate these principles, and have our scientific community study them and adapt according to local factors of agriculture.
So again “Why Organic Farming ??” – Hunzian health.
