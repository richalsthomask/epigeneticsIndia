We do not need to hypothesize or speculate about what might happen if we transition from chemical intensive inorganic farming to organic farming overnight, we know what will happen – how? Sri Lanka.

The Financial meltdown that happened in Sri Lanka in 2021, was marked by a number of disastrous policy decisions on part of the Sri Lankan ruling elite ; chief among them , banning inorganic fertilizers and pesticides for the “emperor’s vision and dream” to regenerate the health of common people and to set Sri Lanka as the prototype for a fully organically farmed country.

This “emperor’s vision and dream” is an outright propaganda designed to fool the citizens. The whole reason for this organic farming policy can be summed up as follows:

The failing economy meant depleted foreign reserves, which they then had to ration for international trade. No chemical fertilizers and pesticides meant more foreign reserves for other purposes like petroleum and hence the change in farming policy.

The result – widespread crop failure and starvation.

The question now beckons, if organic farming is such a sound methodology why can’t we transition overnight? – Once soil fertility is lost, to reinstate it the soil needs time to regenerate itself and also help from the outside(yes, the humans) with sound scientific principles. We cover soil regeneration in detail later, but to sum it up it involves composting, subsoiling, plants for targeted nutrition including green manuring, PH rebalancing.

The time for regeneration depends on the degree of lost fertility, local variable factors such as type of soil, climatic condition etc. The human action is very important and inseparable for soil regeneration.

Under Sir Albert Howard, various farms under inorganic farming were transitioned to organic farms. None of them were overnight. They built up infrastructure for organic farming and started applying its principles, all the while continuing to use inorganic methods such as chemical fertilizers , pesticides etc in lower doses. The amount of pesticides, insecticides, chemical fertilizers required for good crop yield reduced year on year to the point where they were totally unnecessary.

These sudden transitionary measures are not in YOUR interests, and the guaranteed resulting failure doesn’t show the true nature of organic farming. It only serves the purpose of pressure groups looking for restructuring inorganic farming in numerous possible ways.
