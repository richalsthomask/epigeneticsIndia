The idea of overall transition to organic farming (in the long term) is generally met with certain sceptical but relevant questions, which vast majority of people who are aware of the harmful farming practices don’t have an answer to. The general argument goes something like;

Organic farming will lead to food shortage as the output per acreage gets reduced drastically without chemical fertilizers.

Organically farmed lands will have pests and insects run riot

Organic Farming is primitive in our scientific age where specialized problems have case specific optimum solutions.

Addressing the food security problem, we can represent it in two parts.

Firstly , Are there more pests and insects destroying the produce under organic farming?

Secondly, Is the output of produce equal under both methods of farming?

**Firstly** , Is there more pests and insects destroying the produce under organic farming?

Fig 2 – The experiment to prove the hypothesis – Lack of Soil aeration can lead to pest infestations.

Sir Albert Howard’s experiment for Soil aeration, an interesting and profound observation was made on pests:

“In the plum interesting changes occurred. In July 1922, less than a year after planting the grass, the new shoots showed arrested growth and the foliage was attacked by leaf-destroying insects, which, however, ignored the leaves of the neighbouring cultivated plot.”

The insects attacked selectively. Why?

Sir Albert Howard adds to his assessment as follows

“The chief pest of fruit trees at Quetta was green-fly soon after the young leaves appeared. This could be produced or avoided at will by careful attention to cultivation and irrigation. Any interference with soil aeration brought on this trouble; anything which promoted soil aeration prevented it. I frequently produced a strong attack of green-fly on peaches and almonds by over-irrigation during the winter and spring, and then stopped it dead by deep cultivation. The young shoots were covered with the pest below, but the upper portions of the same shoots were completely healthy. The green-fly never spread from the lower to the upper leaves on the same twig. The tribesmen got over the tendency of these loess soils to pack under irrigation in a very simple way. Lucerne was always grown in the fruit orchards, and regularly top-dressed with farm-yard manure. In this way the porosity of the soil was maintained and the green-fly kept in check.”

In this case of soil mismanagement, the relation is simple: The lesser the soil aeration the more the damage caused by pests and insects.

Sir Albert Howard was able to produce attacks by pest and reverse it at his will on a given piece of land. He used soil aeration to alter the pest infestation like a knob of a thermostat.

This provides sufficient proof, from detailed experiments by a widely acknowledged scientist, Sir Albert Howard, **_that mismanagement of soil results in widescale damage from pests and that sound farming practices as in organic farming, produces almost zero damage to the produce from pests, insects etc._**

**Coming on to the second question,**

How does the output per acreage compare between inorganic and organic farming?

The answer to this question lies on what metrics we use to measure the output; Quantity or Quality? Or both?

If the produce is measured by quantity alone inorganic farming is preferable, whereas by quality alone organic farming is superior. An optimal combination of quantity and quality is preferrable, but it is prone to subjective biases.

Let’s use a hypothesis.

**Variety A**

Consider an apple of variety A being farmed in a given piece of land and taking the pessimism into consideration,

under inorganic farming, the produce be 200 apples each weighing 1 kg.

Quantity = 200 \* 1 = 200 kg

Under organic farming, the produce be 100 apples each weighing ½ kg.

Quantity = 100 \* ½ = 50 kg

Which is preferrable is complicated but using my rationale even I would select inorganic farming, unless we consider………………………..THE VARIETY.

But here again we need to consider another important aspect – the variety.

Lots of varieties are selected today for their pest resistance properties, longer shelf life, ability to withstand specific herbicides etc. This comes at the cost of nutrition.

So variety A would be, as a rule, generally be very low in its nutrition.

**Variety B**

Now if we were to farm the most nutritious variety, say variety B under both organic and inorganic farming, we can hypothesize what would probably happen.

Inorganic farming methods, the produce would be very low in quantity.

Since the plants are not selected for their disease resistance the pest attacks will be more, pesticides less effective and less produce in quantity as well as quality.

The herbicides cannot be used like in the earlier variety, since this variety doesn’t withstand its use.

Organic farming methods, produce more or less unchanged in quantity

Since organic farming links the damages suffered by the produce to soil mismanagement, there should be no change in the produce(maybe even higher yield).

_The case of food security therefore comes down to;_

_The choice between 50 kg of organically farmed nutritious variety B and 200 kg of poison sprayed less nutritious variety A_

There are the ketonic diet people, the vegan people, say no to carb people, eat only meat people etc. There are sub categories like the red meat hating people and red meat for eternity people.

For this study I abstain from expressing my views on the matter of diet

The choice of A or B is something you have to answer for yourself. No wrong answers, you will always have company.

The point being that, It is entirely possible that we can attain more nutrition from consuming lesser quantity of food.

Food security should, therefore, be unaffected provided the right policy framework is implemented; selection of variety, education of right farming practices, resources made available, and most importantly slow and careful transition (unlike Sri Lanka).
